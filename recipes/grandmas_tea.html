        <h2>Most Importantly.. Warms the Heart &hearts; </h2>
        <p>It is perfect to let simmer on the stove to make the house smell good and to serve to guests. I have
            no idea why its called 'Russian' tea; that is just what my grandmother always called it. Use any tea
            you like. I've used regular black tea, decaf, and cinnamon spice, and it's all great. If using
            spiced tea, you may want to adjust the amount of cinnamon, cloves, and allspice. This is also great
            reheated!
